Hi Helen, use this time to understand how insights is working especially the following components:
ClickMap Registration and Storage in Mongo
ClickMap fetch to UI and how it gets rendered with the clickmarker data in Vertica
The table component
The graph component
The filter component
Whats stored in Mongo for Insights (based on what Iâ€™d shared with you the other day)

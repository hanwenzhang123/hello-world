Hi Helen, use this time to understand how insights is working especially the following components:
ClickMap Registration and Storage in Mongo
ClickMap fetch to UI and how it gets rendered with the clickmarker data in Vertica
The table component
The graph component
The filter component
Whats stored in Mongo for Insights (based on what Iâ€™d shared with you the other day)

Reporting | Graph | UI Change | Show better association between primary and secondary dimension


In bar graph, to better show association between primary and secondary dimension, a visual element from a Sankey diagram would look good.
Attached screenshot: Instead of Male/Female showing on the bar, they would be displayed on the Y axis. Would require the bars to be moved further to the right to show association between Primary and Secondary Dimension
